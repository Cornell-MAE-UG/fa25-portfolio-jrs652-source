In this problem, we were given a 2D design space of the dimensions 1.5m long and .5m tall, along with a rod of variable length, three pins, and a catalog from which to pick an actuator to design a frame/mechanism to lift the heaviest object the highest. To do this, it is important to establish that I will be considering the weight of the bar to be irrelevant, and will be setting it to zero. The only two external forces on the bar will then be the weight of the object and the upward force of the piston in this setup. Additionally, these IMA actuators cap out at 36 kN, so that has to be the maximum weight. The actuator will be positioned fairly close to the weight itself on the end of the rod, which allows a high height value without straining the pins from high moments at a long arm.
